# Simple-CDBLevel-Sample
A simple way to create and load levels using Heaps' CdbLevel class

This is mainly a way to help people learn how to load CastleDB files as levels into Heaps. It's not too difficult.

The level was put together by me but the pixel art was created by the amazing artsybarrels on commission.
